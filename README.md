# Deploying-Machine-Learning-Models-with-Streamlit
Here this code implements an end-to-end machine learning deployment pipeline using Streamlit for the frontend interface and SQL Server for backend data storage. It creates a loan approval prediction system where users can input applicant details (age, income, credit score, and loan amount), and the application generates real-time predictions using a RandomForest classifier. The system stores all user inputs and prediction results (including approval/denial decisions and probability scores) in a structured SQL Server database with proper table relationships. For analytics, it provides interactive visualizations of historical predictions, including approval rates and feature distributions, while also tracking model performance metrics like accuracy and precision. The implementation follows database best practices with proper DDL (table creation), DML (data insertion), and TCL (transaction control) commands, making it a complete example of deploying ML models with persistent storage and monitoring capabilities.
